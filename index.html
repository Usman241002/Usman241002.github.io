                    ExTracker is a user-friendly web application for managing financial records. It allows users to log expenses, track spending, and manage unapproved claims with an approval workflow for managers. Featuring a clean green-themed interface, it ensures usability and readability. Built with PHP and MySQL, this project demonstrates my ability to create efficient full-stack applications with secure user authentication and dynamic front-end functionality.</p>

                    <i>"Ad & Costsheet Generator"</i> is an early coding project designed to streamline tasks for car dealerships by automating the creation of folders and advertisements. Developed for use in a Command Terminal, it allows efficient input of vehicle information, saving time and improving reliability. Despite its lack of visual design due to being created before I learned HTML and CSS, the program is currently used by two dealerships in Birmingham, UK. This project highlights my ability to deliver practical, efficient solutions to real-world problems.</p>
